In header section were also known as the header class, I used flexbox properties to position all the elements such as:

        .header -- I assigned this as the parent container by giving display: flex; and I applied flex-direction: column; so that the flexible items are displayed vertically, as a column and relative position. I also applied z-index as 1 (I needed to assign this in order for our square shape to appear in the header.)

 And since I applied relative positioning to my "parent" - I am able to apply the absolute position to header__subtitle so I can be able to position it in a proper place based on the brief also assigned top and bottom value.

Description block: 
 In this part, I assigned .two-columns as the parent container by assigning display:flex; to it. And, justify-content as space-between in order for the element to have space between each other then assigned some properties like width, color and etc. based on the brief. Of course, I assigned margin - really important.

The main problem with education 

Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. We often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness, and there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass our tests. 

Here's the real question: does this approach of repetition and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?

Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to the educational process to help make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.

Digits block: 
First of all the section-title, where the title of the block written in it. I did not assigned any special properties to it. in order for it to be in the center, I assigned:  text-align as center and apply the respective properties such as line-height, font-size, font-weight, and so son. Same thing, I did to section-subtitle. About the table, I use the ul li properties to form a table. and assigned the table class as a parent container. wrap it together by assigning flex-wrap: wrap; and assigned justify-content as space-between so the table__cell will have spaces between each other. And to remove the bullet I assigned ' list-style-type as none to table__cell.

Feynman block:
In this part, As you can see the brief there's an image background in this part. In order to appear the image 
I assigned background-image to .feynman since its a decorative image. After that, I used background-repeat: no-repeat in order for our background not to repeat, assigned background position property and so son. In .feynnman__link, I assigned an absolute positioning, in order for me to position in the right side of the block.

Kaufman block: In this block, to .kaufman: I applied relative position, z-index as 1, overflow hidden (in order for the kaufman__triangle to hide some part of that overflow). In kaufman__triangle, I used BEM mix in order to apply animation to the image and make it rotate 360deg and move repetitively in a loop. In the table, I assigned the same properties as I assigned the previous table.

Ten principles of rapid skill acquisition

1. Choose a lovable project
2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time
3. Define your target performance level
4. Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills
5. Obtain critical tools
6. Eliminate barriers to practice
7. Make dedicated time for practice
8. Create fast feedback loops
9. Practice by the clock in short bursts
10. Emphasize quantity and speed
